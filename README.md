# learning-go

# What is this?

A public Repo on Github to provide resources for Learning the Language 'Go' 

# Intro

Initially will be some basic things with a final objective to a web based eg game using a
game development package

# Knowledge required

It is expected that some basic knowledge of Go is already known - there is no point
in re-inventing the wheel when great resouces already exist e.g. https://tour.golang.org/
(Please read that site, get some knowledge of variables, interfaces, methods, functions,
etc

You should also reference the main project Documentation - https://golang.org/doc/

Then you can start going through the examples etc here.

Yes, we do have Hello World as an example (as do any tutorials) but that is to ensure that 
you dont have problems getting started

# Getting Started

First you will need to Install Go

https://golang.org/doc/install

We assume you already have a working Git environment on your system , if not, install 'git'
or Github Desktop

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git or 
https://desktop.github.com/

To get a file, simply check it out of Github and then run it locally 

git checkout alanbuxey/learning-go
cd learning-go
go build xxxx.go      (replace xxxx with file of interest)
./xxxx   (replace xxxx with file thats just been generated)
